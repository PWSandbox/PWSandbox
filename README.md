PWSandbox is a **Windows-only** app!
If you're not on Windows, check out [PWSandboxConsole](https://github.com/PWSandbox/PWSandboxConsole): a **cross-platform** *console* version of PWSandbox.

> [!WARNING]
> PWSandboxConsole is still in the early stages of development. Expect a lot of bugs.
>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are no compiled assemblies of PWSandboxConsole. You will have to compile it yourself.
