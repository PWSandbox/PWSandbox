## Cross-platform alternative

Replacing WinForms with something cross-platform is planned for version 2.0 (see [issue #28](https://github.com/PWSandbox/PWSandbox/issues/28)),
however for now PWSandbox is **Windows-only**.

If your OS isn't Windows, check out [PWSandbox.Tui](https://github.com/PWSandbox/PWSandbox.Tui): a **cross-platform** *console* version of PWSandbox.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are no compiled assemblies of PWSandbox.Tui. You will have to compile it yourself.
